			This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally identifiable information' (PII) is being used online.
			PII, as used in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context.
			Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.

			We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information.
		</p>
		<br />
		<p><b>Do we use 'cookies' ?</b></p>
		<p>
			Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain information.
			They are also used to help us understand your preferences based on previous or current activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services.

			You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies. You can do this through your browser (like Internet Explorer) settings.

		<p><b>California Online Privacy Protection Act</b></p>
		<p>
			CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.
			The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world)
			that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected
			and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy.<br />

		</p>
		<br />
		<p><b>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</b></p>
		<p>
			When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under 13, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, the nation's
			consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.<br />
			We do not specifically market to children under 13.
