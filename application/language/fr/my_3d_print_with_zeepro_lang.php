<br />
Thank you for your interest in joining #My3DPrintWithZeepro Week! We're excited to share this 3D printing experience with you.<br />
<br />
We're experiencing a high volume of applications. Due to this, every single applicant may not be able to launch a print at the time of the March 20, 2015 campaign week. Yet, we are considering to have a second 3D printing session in the future so all interested applicants could try ZeeproShare.<br />
<br />
You will be alerted via email if you are a part of the first session. From there, you will be able to choose a date and time that best fits your schedule to launch and watch your 3D object print in real time! If you have any questions or concerns please email <a href=\"mailto:My3DPrint@Zeepro.com\">My3DPrint@Zeepro.com</a>.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
The Zeepro Team<br />
